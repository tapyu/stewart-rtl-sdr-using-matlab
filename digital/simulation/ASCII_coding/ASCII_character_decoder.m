%% Convert bit sequence to ASCII string 
% The code below takes the bit sequence input, and converts it back to the 
% original character string. It accomplishes this by processing one  
% character at a time, extracting the bit representation of each,   
% converting it to its decimal value, and then converting it back to a   
% character. These characters are then stored in a 'message' variable for
% displaying the full message in the command window.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
msg_len = length(bin_seq)/ascii_len;    % calc message length in chars
msg_decoded = char(zeros(1,msg_len));   % create variable for decoded msg      

% convert the binary sequence back to an English message
for count = 1:1:msg_len
    % extract binary representation of each character
    char_in_bin = bin_seq((((count-1)*ascii_len)+1):ascii_len*count)';
    % 'bi2de' converts binary representation to decimal value
    char_in_dec = bi2de(char_in_bin,'left-msb');
    % convert to character and store character
    msg_decoded(count) = char(char_in_dec);
end

% print the message to the command window
disp(msg_decoded);
